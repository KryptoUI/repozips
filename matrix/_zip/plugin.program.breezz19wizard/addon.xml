		<news>1.1.0 - Fixed Resolveurl path in save data. 1.0.9 - Added settings to main menu. 1.0.8 - Fixed percentage during build download, 1.0.7 - Added option to link to another xml or json file. This is good for teams or community wizards as each builder can have their own xml. Also changed format of the builds xml. Please refer to builds_newformat.xml located in the resources folder. The old format will still work but if the user is running an older version of the wizard, they'll only see the version number as the name. They'll want to update to fix that. 1.0.6 - Added Notifications Dialog.
